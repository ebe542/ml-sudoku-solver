## Data Generation

Complete and valid Sudoku solutions are generated using randomized backtracking.

The dataset generator creates incomplete puzzles by copying each solution and replacing randomly selected cells with `0`.

```text
Complete Sudoku solution
          │
          ├── preserved as ground truth
          │
          └── randomly remove cells
                        │
                        ▼
               Incomplete puzzle
```

A value of `0` represents an empty Sudoku cell.

The generated data is reproducible through configurable random seeds.

## Feature Representation

Each empty cell becomes an individual machine learning sample.

The current feature vector contains 118 values:

| Feature Group | Feature Count |
|---|---:|
| Grid values | 81 |
| Target cell position | 1 |
| Candidate indicators | 9 |
| Row candidate interactions | 9 |
| Column candidate interactions | 9 |
| Block candidate interactions | 9 |
| **Total** | **118** |

The target is the correct digit from the corresponding solved Sudoku.

### Candidate Indicators

For each digit from 1 to 9, a binary feature indicates whether the digit is a valid candidate for the target cell.

```text
1 = valid candidate
0 = invalid candidate
```

Candidates are calculated from the incomplete puzzle using row, column, and 3×3 block constraints.

### Candidate Interactions

Candidate interaction features count how often each digit appears as a candidate in other empty cells within the same:

- row,
- column,
- 3×3 block.

These features provide context about relationships between the target cell and its peer cells.

## Data Splitting Strategy

The hold-out dataset is split at the level of complete Sudoku solutions before cell-level feature extraction.

```text
Solved Sudoku A ──┐
Solved Sudoku B ──┼──→ Training solutions
Solved Sudoku C ──┘

Solved Sudoku D ──┐
Solved Sudoku E ──┼──→ Test solutions
Solved Sudoku F ──┘
```

This prevents cell samples derived from the same Sudoku from appearing in both the training and test sets.

## Grouped Cross-Validation

For cross-validation, every cell-level sample receives the identifier of its source Sudoku.

`GroupKFold` ensures that all samples from one Sudoku remain within the same fold.

```text
Sudoku 1
├── Cell sample 1
├── Cell sample 2
└── Cell sample 40
        │
        ▼
  Shared group ID
```

This avoids data leakage and provides a more reliable estimate of model generalization.

## Components

### SudokuGrid

Responsible for representing Sudoku grids and validating:

- dimensions,
- allowed values,
- row constraints,
- column constraints,
- 3×3 block constraints.

### Sudoku Solution Generator

Generates complete and valid Sudoku solutions using randomized backtracking.

### Dataset Generator

Creates incomplete Sudoku puzzles from solved grids and preserves the complete solutions as ground truth.

### Data Preparation

Creates solution-level training and test datasets.

### Feature Preprocessing

Converts incomplete puzzles into cell-level machine learning samples with grid, candidate, and interaction features.

### Random Forest Model

Provides the current baseline classification model.

The model supports:

- training from an `MLDataSplit`,
- training directly from feature and target arrays,
- prediction,
- accuracy evaluation.

### Evaluation

Contains reusable evaluation logic, including:

- grouped cross-validation for cell-level prediction,
- end-to-end hybrid solver evaluation,
- solution and validity rates,
- runtime measurement,
- deterministic-step, ML-decision, and backtracking statistics.

### Analysis

Contains tools for understanding model behavior, including:

- error analysis,
- accuracy by candidate count,
- confusion matrix evaluation,
- feature-importance analysis.

### Hybrid Solver

The hybrid solver combines three mechanisms:

1. Minimum-remaining-values cell selection prioritizes the most constrained empty cell.
2. Random Forest probabilities rank valid candidates when multiple choices remain.
3. Recursive backtracking reverses choices that lead to contradictions.

Machine-learning output affects search order only. Candidate filtering and the final solution remain governed by deterministic Sudoku constraints.

## Current Results

| Feature Representation | Test Accuracy |
|---|---:|
| Grid and cell position — 82 features | 11.75% |
| Candidate indicators — 91 features | 50.25% |
| Candidate interactions — 118 features | 66.50% |

Five-fold grouped cross-validation produced:

| Metric | Accuracy |
|---|---:|
| Mean | 65.83% |
| Standard deviation | 1.63 percentage points |
| Minimum | 63.38% |
| Maximum | 67.37% |

The first end-to-end evaluation used 20 independently generated puzzles with a removal rate of 0.5:

| Metric | Result |
|---|---:|
| Puzzles solved | 20 / 20 |
| Valid solution rate | 100.00% |
| Average runtime | 20.64 ms |
| Deterministic steps | 774 |
| ML decisions | 26 |
| Backtracks | 0 |

The 800 placements consisted of 96.75% deterministic steps and 3.25 % ML-ranked decisions. At this removal rate, constraint propagation therefore
performs most of the solving work.

## Current Limitation

The current end-to-end benchmark covers only 20 puzzles at one removal rate.
It does not yet compare ML-guided candidate ordering with a non-ML baseline or measure behavior across multiple puzzle difficulty levels.
